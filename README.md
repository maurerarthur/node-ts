# node-ts
Boilerplate to work with Typescript in a Node.js environment.

# Instructions
All the files inside the /src folder will be watched by nodemon, and you need the ts-node package to run Typescript.
To generate a Vanilla Javascript build just type in the terminal:
```
npm run build
```
And then run with:
```
npm start
```

# How to change the default configuration
Just go to the tsconfig.json file, where you can change the target Javascript version, the input and output folder of the files, among other options.
